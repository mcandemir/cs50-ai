<h1>CS50-AI</h1>
I plan to take a couple courses to learn more about AI and machine learning in preparation for third year and future job opportunities.

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.

<h1>Project 0</h1>
Degrees: Program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.
TicTacToe: Using Minimax, an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

<h1>Project 1</h1>
