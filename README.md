<h1>CS50-AI</h1>
I plan to take a couple courses to learn more about AI and machine learning in preparation for third year and future job opportunities.

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.
